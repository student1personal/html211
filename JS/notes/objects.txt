 Objects are physical entities which contains properties and methods.
 eg: let obj = {
    name:"raj",
    age:30,
    email:'a@a.com'
 }
 objects can be accessed by dot notation(objectname.propertyname) or
 index signature(objectname['propertyname'])

 By default everything in js ends up as object. There is underlying inheritance called prototype inheritance
