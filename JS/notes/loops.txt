Loops: loops will repeat again and again. each repitition is called iteration
We have primarily two sets of loops exist.
  i. entry control loops : eg:while,for etc..,
  ii. exit control loops : eg: do while 
i. Entry control loops: these loops checks the conditionat the starting/entry.
A loop contains three phases (initialization, condition, updation)
