Array is a collection of elements.Arrays always use square brackets. arrays stores the elements with unique addresses called index. index always starts from 0
Arrays have a property called length. length will print total number of elements in the array
eg: arr= [5,7,8,9,6];

Arrays have some default methods:
  *** Arrays are non primitive datatype and mutable. non primitve datatypes compares the reference/address not the value unlike primitive
  let x="raj",y="raj"
  console.log(x==y)
  let a=[1,2],b=[1,2];
  console.log(a==b)

  i. push(): push is used to push an element at the end of the array and it returns the length of new array
  ii. pop(): pop is used to remove the last element of the array.
  iii. shift(): shift is used to remove the first element of the array
  iv. unshift(): unshift is used to add elements at the start of the array and it returns the length of new array
  v. splice(starting_index, deleteCount , inserting elements)
       -- if i give only one parameter: it deletes all elements from that index
       -- if i give two parameter: it deletes number of elements as mentioned
       -- if i give three parameters: it deletes based on starting_index, deleteCount and it accepts multiple value to store

// Array iterators
forEach() -- forEach is used  to iterate all the values of the array and pass a callback for each and every element of the array

  arrayName.forEach(callback);
But forEach cannot return any value

map():  --- map is used to iterate all the values of the array and pass a callback for each and every element of the array but it also can return the values

arrayName.map(callback)

filter() --- filter is used to iterate all the values of the array and pass a callback for Each and every element of the array but it returns only elements whose condition is true

arrayName.filter(callback)

some() --- some is used to check atleast for one of the value of array, the given condition must be true. else it returns false
let vari_name = arrayName.some(callback)

every() --- every is used to check whether all the values of the array are satisfying the given condition or not
let vari_name = arrayName.every(callback)

find()  --- find is used to find the first element that satisfies the given considition
let vari_name = arrayName.find(callback)

reduce() --- reduce is used to find the cumulative values such that each values uses its previous result
 arrayName.reduce(callback(prev,ccurr),initial_value)
