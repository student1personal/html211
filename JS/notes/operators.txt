operators: operators are used to perform an operation between operands.
Eg: a+b is an addition operation with '+' as a operator and a,b are operands
There are several operators such as
   i. arithematic operators: 
         arithematic operators are used to perform basic arithematic operators 
         +  -- used for addition
         -   -- used for subtraction
         *  -- used for multiplication
         /   -- used for division
         % -- used for remainder
         ** -- used for power
   ii. relational operators:
           relational operators are used to perform comparisons and return boolean values
          > -- greater than
          < -- less than
          >= -- greater than or equals to
          <= -- less than or equals to
          ==  --  double equals is used to compare two values
          === -- triple equals is used to compare two values and datatypes
          != -- will be true when both are not equal to each other
          !== will be true when both are not equal to each other value or datatype
  eg: '5'==5 ---> T , '5'===5 --->false
         0==false---> true , 0===false -->F
         '1' == true --->T  , '1'===true  --->F
   iii. logical operators:
           logical operators are used to perform logical conditions such as
         and -- &&  -- used to check multiple conditions based on AND. will be true when the both values are true 
         Eg: (5>2) && (5>4)
         or  -- || -- used to check multiple conditions based on OR. will be true when the any ot the  values are true 
         Eg: (5>2) || (5>6) 
         not -- ! -- used to check whether condition is false or not.
        Eg: !(10>5)  -- F
    iv. assignment operators:
           Assignment operators are used to assign certain values.
        +=  ---->eg: a+=2 => a=a+2
        -=  ---->eg: a-=2 => a=a-2
        *=  ---->eg: a*=2 => a=a*2
        /=  ---->eg: a/=2 => a=a/2
        %=  ---->eg: a%=2 => a=a%2
        **= ---->eg: a**=2 => a=a**2
     v.Increment and Decrement operators:
           Increment and Decrement operators are used to increase or decrease the value by 1.
           Increment(++):Increment can be done in two ways
            1.pre-increment: pre increment first increases the value and then assigns the value
            eg:++a;
            2.post-increment:post-Increment first assigns the value and then increment
            eg:a++;
            Same things,applies to decrement also
    vi. Ternary operators:
          Ternary operators are used to choose between two options based on a condition
          eg: let c = (a>5) ? 10 :20;
          if the condition a>5 is true then c=10;
          else c=20;
    vii. unary + or unary -: These are used to convert any datatype to numbers. unary + is the recommanded one
    viii. nullish coelsion operator: it is used when the decision needs to be done with empty or unknown values.
