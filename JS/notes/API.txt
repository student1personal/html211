API(Application Programming Interface) :
    It is the bridge that connects client with server. There are differnt types of API's. Most popular API for web is REST API.
REST API: They transfer the data in JSON format
Eg: [
    {
        "name":"raj",
        "age":50
    },
    {
        "name":"sita",
        "age":55
    }
]
Every API data will be transferred through an end point.
eg: https://fakestoreapi.com/products

we can access API data using fetch
In olden days we used to achieve it by XHR(xmlHttpRequest) but broweser developed default web api to connect the endpoint

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.log('Error:', error));



API can have so many requests such as
  GET: used to get all the data from an endpoint
  POST: used to give the data to endpoint
  DELETE: used to delete particular data using endpoint
  PUT: used to update whole data using endpoint
  PATCH: used to update particular data using endpoint

  fetch(url,{
    method:"POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH"
    data: data
  })



Promises usually use then and catch but understanding then and catch in complex chaining will be difficult. There is a modern approach to do promises called async-await
