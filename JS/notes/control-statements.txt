control statements are used to control the flow or execution of the code.
   i. if:
   //simple if
   it executes a set of statements once condition is true
   if(condition){
    //code
   }
   //if..else
   it executes a set of statements when condition is true and another set of statements when condition is false
   if(condition){
    //code
   }
   else{
    //code
   }
   // if--else--if
   it executes multiple conditions or options to check. 
   if(condition){
    //code
   }
   else if(condition){
    //code
   }
   else{
    
   }


Imagine a situation to print name of the month or name of the week based on its number. Instead of using multiple if else if, we can use switch case

switch: switch works one of the option between multiple options easily. it uses cases with respective match and includes the default also
syntax: switch(expression/value){
   case value1: //code;
               break;
   case value2: //code;
               break;
   case value3: //code;
               break;
   case value4: //code;
               break;
   default:code;
}

break is a keyword to stop the execution of current block further
